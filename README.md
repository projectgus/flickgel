Flickgel is a small web app to share HTML or BBCode for multiple
Flickr images without needing to visit each photo and click 'Share'.

Runs entirely on the client side in JavaScript. Built as a learning
project to get the hang of [angular.js](http://angularjs.org).

# Dependencies

Built with assistance of many free software libraries, all included under lib/:

* [angular.js](http://angularjs.org)

* [Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

* [Bootstrap Daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker)

# Running it yourself

Runs entirely in the browser so easy to host yourself. Just put a file 'apikey.js' into the js/ directory, containing your API key in this format:

    API_KEY = "<putyourownapikeyhere>";

# Known Issues

* Has no tests.

* My first angular.js project and one of the first things I've done with
  JavaScript for over 5 years. So might be clunky in places.
